Meal Delivery Company
___________________________________________________________________________
The Objectives
The client is a meal delivery company operating across multiple American cities. They have various
order fulfilment centers across these cities for dispatching online meal orders to their customers.
The client wants to leverage the available data and learn whatever they can from it, with an aim of
improving raw material sourcing, staffing of fulfilment centers, optimal pricing/ discounting and
marketing. Given this information, perform explorative data analysis to identify relevant observations
and trends, and present findings in the form of a Power bi dashboard.

My Approach
•	First of all I created a custom table with regular dates using M language.
then I created a new table for Slicer table for explicit measures as we can’t use explicit measure in slicer directly, then using Dax formula I created a new calculated measure User Selection using measure selectedvalue(),then using switch function I connected my slicer table to the explicit measure. Now the explicit measure’s slicer is interactive.
•	Created LY & Growth% measures for last year and to calculate the change in growth.
used custom icon using json files.
•	Used all the Major key components Visual (Bar chart, Line chart, Donut Chart, Tree-Map, etc.) which can together provide a holistic view in the form of Dashboard.
